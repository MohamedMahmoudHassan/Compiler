# Compiler
# First two phases of the compiler 
1- lexical analyser 

2- AST(Abtract Parse Tree)


***********************************************
Given the language grammar in the Grammar file ,( any correct grammar) 


the Grammar generator will parse it and build a graph using it 


then the *match ()* function will try to check if the given source code is correct or not


if so "BIG FUDJE" will be printed followed by the AST


if not 


      "BAD FUDJE" will be printed followed meaning that there's syntax error
